# API-Data-Visualization
First time using an API with Python to pull stock history data and push the data into a local MySQL database

This is my first project with an attempt to get data from the internet, place it into a workable format, and use different Python libraries
to visualize the data.

All comments are welcome! I would love input on how to improve this process.
